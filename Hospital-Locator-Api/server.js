/*  below line integrates the cors middleware, which handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which means
By default, browsers block requests from a web page on one "origin" (e.g., http://example.com:3000) to a resource on another "origin" (e.g., http://api.example.com:5000). The cors middleware adds the necessary HTTP headers (like Access-Control-Allow-Origin) to your Express.js server's responses, signaling to the browser that it's permissible for specific or all origins to access the server's resources.
for example when front end is running on one origin/domain, browser by default will restrict requests to another origin/domain url on which server is running. Browser if finds necessary header Access-Control-Allow-Origin in server response it will allow the content access on the basis of this header value explained below
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com this value will allow server content access only to https://example.com and     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * means it allows request made from any url to server */
